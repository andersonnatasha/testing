Testing
-------

We have a neat function that adds two numbers together,
using complex math.

First, let's import it::

    >>> from arithmetic import adder

Then, let's try it out::

    >>> adder(1, 1)
    2

See? It works!

What if we used a negative number? ::

    >>> adder(1, -1)
    0

BTW, this text format is called "restructuredText" and is
a nice way to get prettily-formatted text messages to
turn into PDFs, HTML, epubs, etc. That's unrelated to
the topic of testing, though.
